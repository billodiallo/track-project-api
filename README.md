#  A public API for a project tracker app

In this project, we're set up a simple Rails API-only-application where Programmers can have multiple
projects that work on and projects can belong to multiple programmers.
Programmers can be assigned to or removed from projects.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.1
- Ruby on Rails v6.1.4


## Current API Endpoints

The API will expose the following RESTful endpoints.
### BaseUrl: {Host-URL}/api/v1

| Endpoint                | Functionality                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| GET /programmers        | Get all programmers          |
| POST /programmers       | Add new programmer           |
| GET /projects           | Get all projects             |
| GET /programmers/:id    | Get a specfic programmer     |
| DELETE /programmers/:id | Delete a programmer          |  
| POST /projects          | Add a new project               |
| DELETE /projects/:id    | Delete a project             |
| PUT /projects/:id       | Update a project             |

### Prerequisites

Ruby: 2.7.1
Rails: 6.1.4
Postgres: >=9.5

### Setup

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/billodiallo/track-project-api.git
$ cd track-project-api.git
~~~

Install gems with:

```
bundle install

Setup database with:

> make sure you have postgress sql installed and running on your system

```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:seed
```

### Usage

Start server with:

```
    rails server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Deploy to a live server

Deploying to a live server like Heroku is easy, make sure you have the necessary credentials setup on your local machine

```bash
heroku create
heroku rename app-new-name
git push heroku $BRANCH_NAME:master 
```
if you are already in master branch no need to add $BRANCH_NAME, just use `git push heroku master`

```bash
heroku run rails db:migrate
heroku run rails db:seed
heroku open
```

Enjoy your newly deployed rails API
