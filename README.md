#  A public API for a project tracker app

In this project, we're set up a simple Rails API-only-application where Programmers can have multiple
projects that work on and projects can belong to multiple programmers.
Programmers can be assigned to or removed from projects.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.1
- Ruby on Rails v6.1.4


## Current API Endpoints

The API will expose the following RESTful endpoints.
### BaseUrl: {Host-URL}/api/v1

| POST /api/v1/programmers       | Add new programmer           |
| GET /api/v1/projects           | Get all projects             |
| GET /api/v1/programmers/:id    | Get a specific programmer    |
| DELETE /api/v1/programmers/:id | Delete a programmer          |

### Deploy to a live server

Deploying to a live server like Heroku is easy, make sure you have the necessary credentials setup on your local machine
